## Goal
Document trick-taking rules in docs/RULES.md.

## Scope

### Basic Trick Rules
- Play proceeds clockwise
- Lead player plays first card
- Other players must follow suit if able
- If can't follow suit, must play trump if able
- Highest card of led suit wins (unless trumped)
- Highest trump wins if trump played
- Trick winner leads next trick

### Card Following Rules
1. Must follow suit if possible
2. If can't follow suit, must trump if possible
3. If can't follow or trump, may play any card
4. Must beat if following and able (some variants)

### Trick Storage
- Each player keeps own tricks
- Tricks must maintain order of play
- Cannot manipulate trick order after play
- Only last completed trick can be reviewed during play

### Last Trick
- Special significance for Seven contract
- Trump 7 must win last trick for Seven
- "Silent Seven" if won without announcement (half value)

## Definition of Done
- Trick-taking rules complete in docs/RULES.md
- Card following obligations clear
- Trick storage rules documented
