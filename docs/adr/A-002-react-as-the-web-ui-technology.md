# A-002 — React as the Web UI Technology

Status: Accepted
Date: 2026-02-02

## Decision
Implement the web user interface in React.

## Context
React enables rapid iteration on UI and has strong ecosystem support. The project already anticipates a Redux-style state model, which aligns naturally with typical React state management patterns and predictable rendering.

## Consequences

Positive
* Fast UI development and iteration.
* Natural fit with Redux-like unidirectional data flow.
* Easy to build tooling around debugging and replay.

Trade-offs
* The UI and engine will likely be separated by a contract (API/events/state schema) unless engine code is also available in the JS runtime.
