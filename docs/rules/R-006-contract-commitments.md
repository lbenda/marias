# R-006 - Contract (Commitments)

- Phase: Contract selection

This phase occurs only after Trump Game is selected (R-005).
During this phase, the declarer announces their contract commitment, and defense players may double the stakes or announce their own counter-commitments.

Contracts are not available in Misère or Slam games.

## Contracts

Contracts define scoring obligations that must be fulfilled independently of winning the game.

| Contract      | Requirement                                                    |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Game          | Score more than 50 points                                      |
| Seven         | Win the last trick with a seven of trumps                      |
| Hundred       | Score at least 100 points                                      |
| Hundred-Seven | Score at least 100 points AND win last trick with seven of trumps |

**Notes:**
- The Seven contract requires winning the final trick with any seven of the trump suit. When this happens, the seven becomes the highest card in that trick, overriding normal trump ranking.
- Game winner and contract fulfillment are independent. A player can win the game but fail their contract, or lose the game but fulfill their contract.

## Turn Order

1. **Declarer announces**: Shows the trump card and announces their contract (Game, Seven, Hundred, or Hundred-Seven).
2. **Defense responds**: Each defense player (in clockwise order) responds in turn:
   - **"Good"** – accepts the current state
   - **Double** – increases the multiplier on any existing commitment
   - **Announce contract** – commits defense to fulfilling their own contract

3. **Continue**: Players continue responding until no one raises further.

## Defense Commitments

Defense players (as a team of two) may announce their own contracts in addition to or instead of doubling the declarer's contract.

**Rules:**
- Defense scores are **combined** when evaluating their contracts.
- Both defense players can announce different contracts.
- The same contract cannot be announced by both defense players.
- Defense contracts are evaluated independently from the declarer's contract.

**Example:**
- Declarer: "Game"
- Defense Player 1: "Double" (declarer's Game is now 2x)
- Defense Player 2: "Hundred" (defense commits to scoring ≥100 combined)
- Declarer: "Double" (defense's Hundred is now 2x)

Result: Both commitments are doubled independently.

## Doubling

Each commitment can be doubled independently up to four levels (standard tournament limit).

| Level | Multiplier |
|-------|------------|
| 1     | 2x         |
| 2     | 4x         |
| 3     | 8x         |
| 4     | 16x        |

**Doubling rules:**
- Any player can double any commitment (their own opponent's or their partner's).
- To raise the multiplier higher, the opposing side must raise first.
- Each commitment is doubled independently.
- The standard tournament maximum is 16x (level 4).

**Example progression:**
1. Declarer announces "Hundred"
2. Defense doubles (2x)
3. Declarer redoubles (4x)
4. Defense raises (8x)
5. Declarer reraises (16x)
6. Defense cannot go higher without declarer raising first

## Open Hand

A player may declare **Open Hand** when they believe their hand is unbeatable.

**Procedure:**
1. Player shows all their cards before play begins.
2. Defense examines the cards and either:
   - **Accept** – concede without playing; declarer wins automatically
   - **Play** – proceed with normal trick-taking with declarer's cards visible throughout

**Effects:**
- If defense accepts, declarer wins all declared contracts automatically.
- If defense plays, the game proceeds normally but declarer's cards remain visible.
- Open Hand carries a higher scoring multiplier (see R-009).

**Restrictions:**
- Can only be declared during the contract selection phase.
- Once cards are shown, the declaration cannot be withdrawn.

## Phase Transition

After all responses are complete and no player wishes to raise further:

1. Declarer takes the revealed trump card back into their hand.
2. The game proceeds to Playing Tricks (R-007).
3. The declarer leads the first trick.

## Scoring

Contract fulfillment and game winner are evaluated independently:

- **Win game** = score more points than opponents
- **Fulfill contract** = meet the specific contract requirement

A player may win the game but fail their contract (e.g., score 65 points but committed to Hundred).
Conversely, a player may lose the game but fulfill their contract (e.g., defense scores 105 combined but declarer scores 15, failing their Game contract).

See R-009 for detailed scoring calculations.
