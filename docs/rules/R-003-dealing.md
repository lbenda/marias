# R003 -  Dealing

- Phase: Dealing

## Cutting (Not Shuffling)
In tournament play, cards are **cut, not shuffled**:
- Cutter (player before dealer) cuts with one hand only
- Cut at least 2 cards from top or bottom
- Cannot lift or raise the whole deck
- No counting, sliding, or leafing through cards
- Cutter may request dealer to reshape the deck

**Note:** Casual games may use shuffling. The engine supports both modes.

## Dealing Direction
Cards are dealt **clockwise**, starting with the chooser.

## Dealing Mistakes
One free dealing mistake is allowed per round. Second mistake in the same round is a violation.

## Two-Phase Deal

### Phase A — Initial Deal
1. Dealer cuts (or shuffles in casual mode) and deals cards
2. **Chooser receives 7 cards first**
3. Other players receive their full 10 cards
4. **5 cards remain** on table (not yet dealt)

## Chooser's Decision
After receiving 7 cards, the chooser must decide:

1. **Select trump** — Pick one card from hand and place it **face-down** on the table
   - This card determines the trump suit
   - The card is NOT revealed yet
   - Continue to Phase B

2. **Pass** — Decline to choose trump
   - Remaining 5 cards are dealt: 3 to chooser (total 10), 2 to talon
   - Proceed to bidding phase
   - Other players may bid for contracts

## Phase B — Completing the Deal
If chooser selected trump:
1. Chooser receives **remaining 5 cards** from the deal
2. Chooser now has: 6 + 5 = **11 cards in hand + 1 trump on desk = 12 total**

Note: There is no talon yet — it will be created by the chooser's discard.

## Chooser's Discard Decision
Before asking "Barva?", chooser must discard 2 cards to create the talon. Two options:

### Option 1 — Normal game (with trump)
1. Keep trump on desk
2. Discard 2 cards from the 11 in hand → 9 in hand + 1 trump on desk
3. Ask "Barva?"
4. After "Good": trump returns to hand → 10 cards

### Option 2 — Slam or Misère (without trump)
1. Take trump card back into hand → 12 cards in hand
2. Discard 2 cards from the 12 → 10 cards in hand
3. Declare Slam or Misère (no "Barva?" question needed)

## Asking "Barva?" (Trump?)
After discarding (Option 1), the chooser asks: **"Barva?"** (Trump?)

Other players respond in order:
- **"Good"** (Dobrá) — Accept the trump, game proceeds normally
- **Take talon** — Player takes the 2 talon cards, discards 2, and declares Misère or Slam

## Trump Reveal
If all players say "Good":
1. Chooser **flips the trump card** face-up on the desk
2. Chooser **announces the game type** with trump suit:
   - **"Game in Hearts"** — Basic game in Hearts
   - **"Seven in Hearts"** — Seven in Hearts (win last trick with trump 7)
   - **"Hundred in Hearts"** — Hundred in Hearts (score 100+ points)
   - **"Hundred-Seven in Hearts"** — Both Seven and Hundred combined
3. Chooser **takes the trump card back** into their hand
4. Chooser leads the first trick

**Card count at game start:**
- Each player: 10 cards
- Talon (discarded): 2 cards
- Total: 32 cards

## Card Handling After Play

### Trick Management
- Each player keeps their own won tricks in a pile
- Trick order must not be disturbed (for verification)

### Round Cleanup
- Unplayed cards must be sorted by suit and placed face-down
- Dealer collects cards in specific order for next round
