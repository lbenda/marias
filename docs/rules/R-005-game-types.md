# R-005 - Game Types

- Phase: Game Selection

During the game selection phase, the active player chooses the game type.
The game type determines the overall ruleset and win condition.

| Type       | Description                                    |
|------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Trump Game | Standard game played with a chooser trump suit |
| Misère     | Declarer must not win any trick                |
| Slam       | Declarer must win all tricks                   |

The selecting player becomes the declarer unless another player overrides the choice
by selecting a higher-ranking game type.

**Note:** In a Trump Game, the revealed trump card is visible to all players.
All players know both the trump suit and the exact card used to declare it.
This information is strategically important.

If the selected game type is Trump Game, the chooser (declarer in that time) must select a contract as defined in R-006.

If the selected game type is Misère or Slam, the game proceeds directly to the Bidding phase.

## Turn Order

The player in the chooser position initiates the Game Selection phase. He becomes the first declarer.

After discarding talon, the declarer must select one of the available game types.

## Game Type Ranking

Game types are ordered by strength.
A game type may only be overridden by selecting a strictly higher-ranked type.

Ranking (from lowest to highest):

1. Trump Game
2. Misère
3. Slam

## Overriding the Game Type

Starting with the player to the left of the current declarer and continuing clockwise,
each player may either:

- accept the selected game type, or
- override it by selecting a higher-ranked game type.

To override a game type, the player must:
1. take the talon,
2. discard an equal number of cards,
3. declare a higher-ranked game type.

The overriding player becomes the new declarer.

## Restrictions

- A player who has taken and discarded the talon may not override the game type again.
- A game type cannot be downgraded or changed to an equal-ranked type.
- Trump Game contracts (Seven, Hundred, etc.) do not apply to Misère or Slam.

## End of Game Selection

The Game Selection phase ends when all players have, in turn order,
either accepted the currently selected game type or are no longer eligible to override it.

Once the phase ends:
- the declarer is fixed,
- the game type is fixed,
- the game proceeds to the Contract Selection phase (Trump Game only)
  or directly to the Bidding phase.
